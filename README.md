# CreditTools.org

Thanks for visiting the README for [CreditTools.org](https://credittools.org)! You can learn more about [CreditTools.org](https://credittools.org) on the website. This GitHub README is written for an audience that wishes to contribute to the website. If you're here to learn how to contribute to the website, thank you! <3

As non-programmers, we have purposefully designed these contribution guidelines to be as simple as possible, and we have aimed these guides at someone who is an enthusiast who is willing to learn a little bit about GitHub, but not enough to commit to a new developer career.

## Adding a new credit card

We have created a form to make it simple to submit research on an ***unlisted*** card. You can access it here: https://credittools.org/docs/credit-card-submission/

Research submission requires a GitHub account to open a new issue with the new credit card information.

Programmers: you open a PR to place the required data for the card in `_cards/` without opening an issue. Please make a new pull request for each card individually, in case people have comments on them.

## Adding a new brand/bank/company

Generally, you will not need to add new companies. In the review process, I will create basic pages from a template that will at least index the brand/bank/company that you have provided research on the card for, if it does not exist already.

Programmers: you can add a new page in `docs/` with the brand/bank/company name. You can use any other brand as a template.

## Updating info on an existing credit card

Open an issue or create a pull request with the changes. Data on each card is available under `_cards/`.

## Updating info on a specific brand/bank/company

Open an issue or create a pull request with the changes. Data on each brand/bank/company is available under `docs/`.

## Card metadata template

We have created a template in `_data/credit_card_template.yml` to serve as the main requirements for adding new cards. This can be improved with a pull request and supportive reasoning/evidence. Please bear in mind that minor changes will likely not be included, since a change to these which will materially change the data for cards can take a lot of review time, since each card needs to be reviewed separately.

## What about debit cards, bank accounts, etc?

Great question! The scope of this website is pretty narrow for now, and it's quite focused on the USA market. In the future, we would like to better design the website to account for different products and different countries. However, unless you are a very motivated person with strong development skills (or, at least better than my "skills"), please hold off on these other contributions until we get at least a basic database of the USA credit cards together.

## What about other languages?

Also a great question! I have little experience with this. If you want to help us out, we would be excited to learn the best way forward to support this. We use [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs).

## Attribution and credits

We would like to thank the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) contributors for building a solid website foundation. We would like to thank all of the [CreditTools.org](https://credittools.org) contributors who believe in an open-source, not-for-profit, and educational website for credit card information. We would like to thank GitHub for allowing us to host this static website with GitHub pages.

## Getting help

The sad truth is that credit cards - despite their incredible utility to some - also contribute to difficult situations for millions of people in the United States and the rest of the world. Further, credit cards arguably provide benefits to people in ethically contentious ways: capitalizing on their function as a "middleman" in transactions, and extracting money out of the economy when no such middleman needs to strictly exist.

While we believe that credit card and related payment companies *can* be a "net positive" with improved payment efficiencies, better access to credit, and other positive factors, we are not oblivious to the fact that the for-profit credit card industry has left many people harmed in its wake, especially minorities.

If you need help paying your credit card debit, getting access to credit, or understanding credit card terms, there are free resources available. We are not affiliated with these groups, but here a few places to start:

* https://consumerfinance.gov - the official website for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. government agency dedicated to making sure you are treated fairly by banks, lenders and other financial institutions.

* https://annualcreditreport.com - the system mandated by the federal goverment through which you can get ***completely free*** credit reports from all three agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Historically, you could get one free credit report per agency per year, but all three have offered more frequent free reports in recent years.

* https://mymoney.gov - the official US government website for the Federal Financial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC), which is collaborating to strengthen financial capability and increase access to financial services for all Americans.
